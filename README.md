Most of the interesting code is in marksface2View.mc <br> <br>
I utilize the "onUpdate" function to call my private functions in order to populate various different fields; and to keep them updated around once per second.

Layout.xml has some default positions for labels along with colors, fontsizes, etc..   These settings can, and in some cases have been overridden in marksface2View.mc code. <br><br>
drawables.xml is the same as Layout.xml, except it's used for bitmaps.
